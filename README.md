## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. Then, open the `.xcworkspace` and run the project within Xcode.

## Installation

ZKCarousel is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

pod 'ZKCarousel'

```

Then, `cd` into the directory containing your `podfile` and run `pod install`

## Usage

`ZKCarousel` can be instantiated either programatically or via Storyboards. 

#### Storyboards

See example project for instructions on how to use `ZKCarousel` with storyboards.

#### Programatically

```swift 
import UIKit
import ZKCarousel

class ViewController : UIViewController {

    let carousel : ZKCarousel = {
        let carousel = ZKCarousel()
        
        // Create as many slides as you'd like to show in the carousel
        let slide = ZKCarouselSlide(image: UIImage(), title: "Hello There üëª", description: "Welcome to the ZKCarousel demo! Swipe left to view more slides!")
        let slide1 = ZKCarouselSlide(image: UIImage(), title: "A Demo Slide ‚òùüèº", description: "lorem ipsum devornum cora fusoa foen sdie ha odab ebakldf shjbesd ljkhf")
        let slide2 = ZKCarouselSlide(image: UIImage(), title: "Another Demo Slide ‚úåüèº", description: "lorem ipsum devornum cora fusoa foen ebakldf shjbesd ljkhf")     
        
        // Add the slides to the carousel
        carousel.slides = [slide, slide1, slide2]
        
        return carousel
    }()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    
        carousel.frame = CGRect()
        view.addSubView(self.carousel)
    }

}

```

#### Auto-Traverse Slides
There is an option to let ZKCarousel switch between slides automatically. All you have to do is use the `start()` and `stop()` functions on ZKCarousel. You can also set the time interval between slides by setting the `interval` property. The default interval is 2 seconds.

See example for a working implementation of this.

#### Custom Gesture Recognizers
If you would like to add a custom action upon tapping the carousel (as opposed to the default action, which changes to the next slide) you will need to first call `disableTap()` to remove the default gesture recognizer, then add your own gesture recognizer to the UICollectionView.
